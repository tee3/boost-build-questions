Hi,

I have been using contrib/boost.jam for many years now and it works
really well.  I'm not sure if there are other people using this or if
this is a normal use case, but it has worked for us.  The Boost.Build
file exports Boost C++ Libraries supported by contrib/boost.jam as
/boost//LIBRARY, which can be referenced from your applications.  It
allows us to build parts of boost as required by the application with
different compilers, options, etc. without having to build all the
parts of boost in advance.

I've run into an issue running with this against the latest 'develop'
branch of the git repository.  I believe this is due to the fact that
there is a target associated with contrib/boost.jam called
/boost//headers, which must be conflicting with the top-level
'headers' target added to the Boost.Build files for building the Boost
C++ Libraries.

I have not looked very deeply into the causes of this, this is all
just a theory.  I did do an experiment where I renamed the 'headers'
target of the Boost C++ Libraries build files to 'generate-headers'
and did not resolve the problem, but resulted in /boost//headers not
being found either.

Questions:

- Has /boost//headers been deprecated/removed from contrib/boost.jam?

- Is contrib/boost.jam still supported?

Please find attached a minimal example that shows the problem and a
log.txt file that shows the output.  To run, use the user-config.jam
instead of the user's user-config.jam.

   $ b2 --user-config=./user-config.jam

Thanks,
Tom
